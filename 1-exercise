# Perl Programming/Exercise 1
#!/usr/bin/perl


## Task: Create a Perl program which displays "Hello world" and then exits.
print "Hello world";
print "\n";


## Displaying numbers
# Put the number 4000/7 into a variable, and display it on screen.
my $value = 4000/7;
print "Result of 4000 divided by 7 is $value";
print "\n";

# Adapt the program to display the number to 3 decimal places. (Hint: The well-known printf works in Perl!)
printf "$value rounded to 3 decimal places is %.3f", $value;
print "\n";

# Adapt the program to round up if the last decimal place is greater than 5
use POSIX;
my $floor = floor( $value );
my $ceil = ceil( $value );
my $num = $value - $floor;
my $newValue;

$num < 0.5 ? ( $newValue = $floor ) : ( $newValue = $ceil );

print "$value rounded to a whole number is $newValue";
print "\n";

# Adapt the program to display the number with leading zeros
my $zeros = 2;
my $newNum = '0' x $zeros . $value;

print "The number $value with $zeros leading zeros is $newNum";
print "\n";

# Adapt the program to show a + sign if the number is positive, and check that it correctly displays a - sign if you subtract 1000 from the number.
my $sign;
$value > 1 ? ( $sign = '+' ) : ( $sign = '-' );

print $sign . $value;
print "\n";


## Functions
# Write a function to calculate the roots of a Quadratic equation, where you give the coefficients a,b,c to the function, and it returns both the values of x
# ( -b +/- sqrt( b^2 - 4ac ) )/ 2a
sub quad {
    my ( $a, $b, $c ) = @_;

    if ( $a == 0 ){
        print "The value of 'a' cannot be zero, please try again \n";
    } else {
        my $x1 = ( -$b + ( $b**2 - ( 4 * $a * $c ) )**0.5 ) / ( 2 * $a );
        my $x2 = ( -$b - ( $b**2 - ( 4 * $a * $c ) )**0.5 ) / ( 2 * $a );
        if ( $x1 eq nan || $x2 eq nan ) {
            print "Not a valid quadratic equation, please try again \n";
        } else {
            print "The result is: $x1 and $x2 \n";
        }
    }
}
print "\n";

## Putting it all together
# Put together these programs into one which:
# Displays a title on screen
# Creates 3 random numbers (a,b,c)
# Displays those numbers neatly formatted
# Uses those numbers as the coefficients of a quadratic equation, calculates and displays both roots.
print "Using the quadratic equation with 3 random numbers \n";
print "Hint: x^2 - 2x - 3 is a quadratic equation. \n";
print "\n";

print "Enter a value for 'a': ";
$a = <STDIN>;
print "\n";

print "Enter a value for 'b': ";
$b = <STDIN>;
print "\n";

print "Enter a value for 'c': ";
$c = <STDIN>;
print "\n";

quad( $a, $b, $c );
print "\n";
